#Requires -Version 5.1

.SYNOPSIS
    Builds an official DELTA Windows Installer release package.

.DESCRIPTION
    Single source of truth for producing release packages - run both by
    developers locally and by GitHub Actions, which invokes this script
    rather than reimplementing any packaging logic of its own.

    Packaging only: copies a fixed whitelist of production files into
    release\DELTA-windows-installer-<Version>\, zips that directory, and
    writes a SHA256 checksum for the zip. Runtime components (Node.js,
    PostgreSQL, PostGIS, the dts_shared_binary artifact) are downloaded
    by setup.ps1 at install time, not bundled here - this script never
    downloads anything, never modifies setup.ps1, and never publishes a
    GitHub Release; those are separate concerns owned elsewhere.

    The whitelist (not an exclude-list) is deliberate: a file added to
    the repository root in the future is excluded from releases by
    default until someone explicitly adds it to $Script:RequiredFiles or
    $Script:OptionalFiles below, rather than leaking into a release
    package unnoticed.

.PARAMETER Version
    Release version, used to name the release directory, the ZIP, and
    the checksum file (e.g. "1.0.0"). Required.

    .\tools\build-release.ps1 -Version 1.0.0
